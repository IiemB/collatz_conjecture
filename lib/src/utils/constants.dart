      'Unsolved problem in mathematics:\n\nDoes the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values?\n\nThe Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture asserts that the total stopping time of every n is finite. It is also equivalent to saying that every n â‰¥ 2 has a finite stopping time. This definition yields smaller values for the stopping time and total stopping time without changing the overall dynamics of the process.';
